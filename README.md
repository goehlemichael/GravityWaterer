## Purpose

Automate the watering of plants using gravity. Using a valve connected to a smart switch. A water reservoir is placed above the plants and a normally closed, on/off solenoid valve controls water flow.

When the smart switch turns on, a valve opens, allowing water to flow.

This is the final Assembly. It has 10 outputs in series and a 1 gallon reservoir placed about 4 feet above the plants on a shelf. I have a no spill quick disconnect to easily detatch the water resovoir and fill when low.
